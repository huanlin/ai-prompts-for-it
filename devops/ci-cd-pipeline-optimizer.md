**Current Pipeline Configuration:**
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: |
          aws s3 sync ./dist s3://my-bucket
          aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id $DIST_ID --paths "/*"

**Environment Details:**
- Platform: GitHub Actions
- Target Environment: AWS (S3 + CloudFront)
- Application Type: React SPA
- Team Size: 5 developers
- Deployment Frequency: Multiple times per day

**Current Pain Points:**
- Builds take 8-10 minutes
- No rollback mechanism
- Manual secret management
- Tests sometimes fail randomly

**Specific Goals:**
- Reduce build time to under 5 minutes
- Implement automated rollbacks
- Improve test reliability
- Add security scanning
```
